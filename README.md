Project: Reiswaage
Author: Martin Boguslawski
last update: 23/07/2021

This project shares an app that guides you through a data acquisition series of a Reiswaage measurement, giving live feedback to the current resultings, and suggests an effective measuring strategy for the selected conditions. The individual measurements can be skipped, corrected, and re-taken by manual selection.

The app was written with the MATLAB app designer, and exported as app installation file to share. This installation file is shared here, as well, but a MATLAB license is necessary for use.
